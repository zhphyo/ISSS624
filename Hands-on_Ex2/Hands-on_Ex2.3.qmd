## **Overview**

In this hands-on exercise, we explore how to compute Global and Local Measure of Spatial Autocorrelation (GLSA) by using **spdep** package.

## **Getting Started**

The code chunk below install and load **spdep**, **sf**, **tmap**, **purrr** and **tidyverse** packages into R environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, spdep, tmap, tidyverse)
```

## **Getting the Data Into R Environment**

### **Import shapefile into r environment**

The code chunk below uses [*st_read()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/st_read.html) of **sf** package to import Hunan shapefile into R. 

```{r}
hunan <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", 
                 layer = "Hunan")
```

### **Import csv file into r environment**

Import *Hunan_2012.csv* into R by using *read_csv()* of **readr** package.

```{r}
hunan2012 <- read_csv("data/aspatial/Hunan_2012.csv")
```

### **Performing relational join**

The code chunk below will be used to update the attribute table of *hunan*'s SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with the attribute fields of *hunan2012* dataframe. 

```{r}
hunan <- left_join(hunan,hunan2012) %>%
  select(1:4, 7, 15)
```

### **Visualising Regional Development Indicator**

Prepare a basemap and a choropleth map showing the distribution of GDPPC 2012 by using *qtm()* of **tmap** package.

```{r}
equal <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_fill("GDPPC",
          n = 5,
          style = "equal") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Equal interval classification")

quantile <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_fill("GDPPC",
          n = 5,
          style = "quantile") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Equal quantile classification")

tmap_arrange(equal, 
             quantile, 
             asp=1, 
             ncol=2)
```

## **Global Spatial Autocorrelation**

### **Computing Contiguity Spatial Weights**

In the code chunk below, [*poly2nb()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/poly2nb.html) of **spdep** package is used to compute contiguity weight matrices for the study area. This function builds a neighbours list based on regions with contiguous boundaries. If you look at the documentation you will see that you can pass a "queen" argument that takes TRUE or FALSE as options. If you do not specify this argument the default is set to TRUE, that is, if you don't specify queen = FALSE this function will return a list of first order neighbours using the Queen criteria.

More specifically, the code chunk below is used to compute Queen contiguity weight matrix.

```{r}
wm_q <- poly2nb(hunan, 
                queen=TRUE)
summary(wm_q)
```

The summary report above shows that there are 88 area units in Hunan. The most connected area unit has 11 neighbours. There are two area units with only one neighbours.

### **Row-standardised weights matrix**

Next, we need to assign weights to each neighboring polygon. In our case, each neighboring polygon will be assigned equal weight (style="W"). This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(#ofneighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values. While this is the most intuitive way to summaries the neighbors' values it has one drawback in that polygons along the edges of the study area will base their lagged values on fewer polygons thus potentially over- or under-estimating the true nature of the spatial autocorrelation in the data. For this example, we'll stick with the style="W" option for simplicity's sake but note that other more robust options are available, notably style="B".

```{r}
rswm_q <- nb2listw(wm_q, 
                   style="W", 
                   zero.policy = TRUE)
rswm_q
```

The input of *nb2listw()* must be an object of class **nb**. The syntax of the function has two major arguments, namely style and zero.poly.

-   *style* can take values "W", "B", "C", "U", "minmax" and "S". B is the basic binary coding, W is row standardised (sums over all links to n), C is globally standardised (sums over all links to n), U is equal to C divided by the number of neighbours (sums over all links to unity), while S is the variance-stabilizing coding scheme proposed by Tiefelsdorf et al. 1999, p. 167-168 (sums over all links to n).

-   If *zero policy* is set to TRUE, weights vectors of zero length are inserted for regions without neighbour in the neighbours list. These will in turn generate lag values of zero, equivalent to the sum of products of the zero row t(rep(0, length=length(neighbours))) %\*% x, for arbitrary numerical vector x of length length(neighbours). The spatially lagged value of x for the zero-neighbour region will then be zero, which may (or may not) be a sensible choice.

### **Global Spatial Autocorrelation: Moran's I**

### **Maron's I test**

The code chunk below performs Moran's I statistical testing using [*moran.test()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/moran.test.html) of **spdep**.

```{r}
moran.test(hunan$GDPPC, 
           listw=rswm_q, 
           zero.policy = TRUE, 
           na.action=na.omit)
```

Statistically significant, P-value 1.095e-06 is less than significance level of 5%.

#### Computing Monte Carlo Moran's I

The code chunk below performs permutation test for Moran's I statistic by using [*moran.mc()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/moran.mc.html) of **spdep**. A total of 1000 simulation will be performed.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
bperm= moran.mc(hunan$GDPPC, 
                listw=rswm_q, 
                nsim=999, 
                zero.policy = TRUE, 
                na.action=na.omit)
bperm
```

Statistically significant, P-value 0.001 is less than significance level of 5%.

#### Visualising Monte Carlo Moran's I

It is always a good practice for us the examine the simulated Moran's I test statistics in greater detail. This can be achieved by plotting the distribution of the statistical values as a histogram by using the code chunk below.

In the code chunk below [*hist()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.6.2/topics/hist) and [*abline()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.6.2/topics/abline) of R Graphics are used.

```{r}
mean(bperm$res[1:999])
```

```{r}
var(bperm$res[1:999])
```

```{r}
summary(bperm$res[1:999])
```

```{r}
hist(bperm$res, 
     freq=TRUE, 
     breaks=20, 
     xlab="Simulated Moran's I")
abline(v=0, 
       col="red") 
```

### **Global Spatial Autocorrelation: Geary's**

#### Geary's C test

The code chunk below performs Geary's C test for spatial autocorrelation by using [*geary.test()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/geary.test.html) of **spdep**.

```{r}
geary.test(hunan$GDPPC, listw=rswm_q)
```

Statistically significant, P-value 0.001526 is less than significance level of 5%.

#### Computing Monte Carlo Geary's C

The code chunk below performs permutation test for Geary's C statistic by using [*geary.mc()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/geary.mc.html) of **spdep**.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
bperm=geary.mc(hunan$GDPPC, 
               listw=rswm_q, 
               nsim=999)
bperm
```

Statistically significant, P-value 0.001 is less than significance level of 5%.

#### Visualising the Monte Carlo Geary's C

Plot a histogram to reveal the distribution of the simulated values by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
mean(bperm$res[1:999])
```

```{r}
var(bperm$res[1:999])
```

```{r}
summary(bperm$res[1:999])
```

```{r}
hist(bperm$res, freq=TRUE, breaks=20, xlab="Simulated Geary c")
abline(v=1, col="red") 
```

## **Spatial Correlogram**

### **Compute Moran's I correlogram**

In the code chunk below, [*sp.correlogram()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/sp.correlogram.html) of **spdep** package is used to compute a 6-lag spatial correlogram of GDPPC. The global spatial autocorrelation used in Moran's I. The **plot()** of base Graph is then used to plot the output.

```{r}
MI_corr <- sp.correlogram(wm_q, 
                          hunan$GDPPC, 
                          order=6, 
                          method="I", 
                          style="W")
plot(MI_corr)
```

By plotting the output might not allow us to provide complete interpretation. This is because not all autocorrelation values are statistically significant. Hence, it is important for us to examine the full analysis report by printing out the analysis results as in the code chunk below.

```{r}
print(MI_corr)
```

### **Compute Geary's C correlogram and plot**

In the code chunk below, *sp.correlogram()* of **spdep** package is used to compute a 6-lag spatial correlogram of GDPPC. The global spatial autocorrelation used in Geary's C. The **plot()** of base Graph is then used to plot the output.

```{r}
GC_corr <- sp.correlogram(wm_q, 
                          hunan$GDPPC, 
                          order=6, 
                          method="C", 
                          style="W")
plot(GC_corr)
```

Similar to the previous step, we will print out the analysis report by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
print(GC_corr)
```

## **Cluster and Outlier Analysis**

### **Computing local Moran's I**

The code chunks below are used to compute local Moran's I of *GDPPC2012* at the county level.

```{r}
fips <- order(hunan$County)
localMI <- localmoran(hunan$GDPPC, rswm_q)
head(localMI)
```

The code chunk below list the content of the local Moran matrix derived by using [*printCoefmat()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/printCoefmat).

```{r}
printCoefmat(data.frame(
  localMI[fips,], 
  row.names=hunan$County[fips]),
  check.names=FALSE)
```

#### Mapping the local Moran's I

Before mapping the local Moran's I map, it is wise to append the local Moran's I dataframe (i.e. localMI) onto hunan SpatialPolygonDataFrame. The code chunks below can be used to perform the task. The out SpatialPolygonDataFrame is called *hunan.localMI*.

```{r}
hunan.localMI <- cbind(hunan,localMI) %>%
  rename(Pr.Ii = Pr.z....E.Ii..)
```

#### Mapping local Moran's I values

Using choropleth mapping functions of **tmap** package, we can plot the local Moran's I values by using the code chinks below.

```{r}
tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +
  tm_fill(col = "Ii", 
          style = "pretty",
          palette = "RdBu",
          title = "local moran statistics") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
```

#### Mapping local Moran's I p-values

The code chunks below produce a choropleth map of Moran's I p-values by using functions of **tmap** package.

```{r}
tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +
  tm_fill(col = "Pr.Ii", 
          breaks=c(-Inf, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, Inf),
          palette="-Blues", 
          title = "local Moran's I p-values") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
```

#### Mapping both local Moran's I values and p-values

For effective interpretation, it is better to plot both the local Moran's I values map and its corresponding p-values map next to each other.

The code chunk below will be used to create such visualisation.

```{r}
localMI.map <- tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +
  tm_fill(col = "Ii", 
          style = "pretty", 
          title = "local moran statistics") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)

pvalue.map <- tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +
  tm_fill(col = "Pr.Ii", 
          breaks=c(-Inf, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, Inf),
          palette="-Blues", 
          title = "local Moran's I p-values") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)

tmap_arrange(localMI.map, pvalue.map, asp=1, ncol=2)
```

## **Creating a LISA Cluster Map**

### **Plotting Moran scatterplot**

The Moran scatterplot is an illustration of the relationship between the values of the chosen attribute at each location and the average value of the same attribute at neighboring locations.

The code chunk below plots the Moran scatterplot of GDPPC 2012 by using [*moran.plot()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/moran.plot.html) of **spdep**.

```{r}
nci <- moran.plot(hunan$GDPPC, rswm_q,
                  labels=as.character(hunan$County), 
                  xlab="GDPPC 2012", 
                  ylab="Spatially Lag GDPPC 2012")
```

Notice that the plot is split in 4 quadrants. The top right corner belongs to areas that have high GDPPC and are surrounded by other areas that have the average level of GDPPC. This are the high-high locations in the lesson slide.

### **Plotting Moran scatterplot with standardised variable**

First we will use [*scale()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/scale) to centers and scales the variable. Here centering is done by subtracting the mean (omitting NAs) the corresponding columns, and scaling is done by dividing the (centered) variable by their standard deviations.

```{r}
hunan$Z.GDPPC <- scale(hunan$GDPPC) %>% 
  as.vector 
```

The [*as.vector()*](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/pbdDMAT/versions/0.5-1/topics/as.vector) added to the end is to make sure that the data type we get out of this is a vector, that map neatly into out dataframe.

Now, we are ready to plot the Moran scatterplot again by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
nci2 <- moran.plot(hunan$Z.GDPPC, rswm_q,
                   labels=as.character(hunan$County),
                   xlab="z-GDPPC 2012", 
                   ylab="Spatially Lag z-GDPPC 2012")
```

### **Preparing LISA map classes**

The code chunks below show the steps to prepare a LISA cluster map.

```{r}
quadrant <- vector(mode="numeric",length=nrow(localMI))
```

Next, derives the spatially lagged variable of interest (i.e. GDPPC) and centers the spatially lagged variable around its mean.

```{r}
hunan$lag_GDPPC <- lag.listw(rswm_q, hunan$GDPPC)
DV <- hunan$lag_GDPPC - mean(hunan$lag_GDPPC)     
```

This is follow by centering the local Moran's around the mean.

```{r}
LM_I <- localMI[,1] - mean(localMI[,1])    
```

Next, we will set a statistical significance level for the local Moran.

```{r}
signif <- 0.05       
```

These four command lines define the low-low (1), low-high (2), high-low (3) and high-high (4) categories.

```{r}
quadrant[DV <0 & LM_I>0] <- 1
quadrant[DV >0 & LM_I<0] <- 2
quadrant[DV <0 & LM_I<0] <- 3  
quadrant[DV >0 & LM_I>0] <- 4      
```

Lastly, places non-significant Moran in the category 0.

```{r}
quadrant[localMI[,5]>signif] <- 0
```

In fact, we can combined all the steps into one single code chunk as shown below:

```{r}
quadrant <- vector(mode="numeric",length=nrow(localMI))
hunan$lag_GDPPC <- lag.listw(rswm_q, hunan$GDPPC)
DV <- hunan$lag_GDPPC - mean(hunan$lag_GDPPC)     
LM_I <- localMI[,1]   
signif <- 0.05       
quadrant[DV <0 & LM_I>0] <- 1
quadrant[DV >0 & LM_I<0] <- 2
quadrant[DV <0 & LM_I<0] <- 3  
quadrant[DV >0 & LM_I>0] <- 4    
quadrant[localMI[,5]>signif] <- 0
```

### **Plotting LISA map**

Now, we can build the LISA map by using the code chunks below.

```{r}
hunan.localMI$quadrant <- quadrant
colors <- c("#ffffff", "#2c7bb6", "#abd9e9", "#fdae61", "#d7191c")
clusters <- c("insignificant", "low-low", "low-high", "high-low", "high-high")

tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +
  tm_fill(col = "quadrant", 
          style = "cat", 
          palette = colors[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1], 
          labels = clusters[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1],
          popup.vars = c("")) +
  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,17)) +
  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)
```

For effective interpretation, it is better to plot both the local Moran's I values map and its corresponding p-values map next to each other.

The code chunk below will be used to create such visualisation.

```{r}
gdppc <- qtm(hunan, "GDPPC")

hunan.localMI$quadrant <- quadrant
colors <- c("#ffffff", "#2c7bb6", "#abd9e9", "#fdae61", "#d7191c")
clusters <- c("insignificant", "low-low", "low-high", "high-low", "high-high")

LISAmap <- tm_shape(hunan.localMI) +
  tm_fill(col = "quadrant", 
          style = "cat", 
          palette = colors[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1], 
          labels = clusters[c(sort(unique(quadrant)))+1],
          popup.vars = c("")) +
  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(11,17)) +
  tm_borders(alpha=0.5)

tmap_arrange(gdppc, LISAmap, 
             asp=1, ncol=2)
```

## **Hot Spot and Cold Spot Area Analysis**

### **Getis and Ord's G-Statistics**

An alternative spatial statistics to detect spatial anomalies is the Getis and Ord's G-statistics (Getis and Ord, 1972; Ord and Getis, 1995). It looks at neighbours within a defined proximity to identify where either high or low values clutser spatially. Here, statistically significant hot-spots are recognised as areas of high values where other areas within a neighbourhood range also share high values too.

The analysis consists of three steps:

-   Deriving spatial weight matrix

-   Computing Gi statistics

-   Mapping Gi statistics

### **Deriving distance-based weight matrix**

First, we need to define a new set of neighbours. Whist the spatial autocorrelation considered units which shared borders, for Getis-Ord we are defining neighbours based on distance.

There are two type of distance-based proximity matrix, they are:

-   fixed distance weight matrix; and

-   adaptive distance weight matrix.

#### Deriving the centroid

We will need points to associate with each polygon before we can make our connectivity graph. It will be a little more complicated than just running *st_centroid()* on the sf object: **us.bound**. We need the coordinates in a separate data frame for this to work. To do this we will use a mapping function. The mapping function applies a given function to each element of a vector and returns a vector of the same length. Our input vector will be the geometry column of us.bound. Our function will be *st_centroid()*. We will be using map_dbl variation of map from the purrr package. For more documentation, check out map documentation

To get our longitude values we map the *st_centroid()* function over the geometry column of us.bound and access the longitude value through double bracket notation \[\[\]\] and 1. This allows us to get only the longitude, which is the first value in each centroid.

```{r}
longitude = map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])
```

We do the same for latitude with one key difference. We access the second value per each centroid with \[\[2\]\].

```{r}
latitude <- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])
```

Now that we have latitude and longitude, we use cbind to put longitude and latitude into the same object.

```{r}
coords <- cbind(longitude, latitude)
```

#### Determine the cut-off distance

Firstly, we need to determine the upper limit for distance band by using the steps below:

-   Return a matrix with the indices of points belonging to the set of the k nearest neighbours of each other by using [*knearneigh()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/knearneigh.html) of **spdep**.

-   Convert the knn object returned by *knearneigh()* into a neighbours list of class nb with a list of integer vectors containing neighbour region number ids by using [*knn2nb()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/knn2nb.html).

-   Return the length of neighbour relationship edges by using [*nbdists()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/nbdists.html) of **spdep**. The function returns in the units of the coordinates if the coordinates are projected, in km otherwise.

-   Remove the list structure of the returned object by using [**unlist()**](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/unlist).

```{r}
#coords <- coordinates(hunan)
k1 <- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords))
k1dists <- unlist(nbdists(k1, coords, longlat = TRUE))
summary(k1dists)
```

The summary report shows that the largest first nearest neighbour distance is 61.79 km, so using this as the upper threshold gives certainty that all units will have at least one neighbour.

#### Computing fixed distance weight matrix

Now, we will compute the distance weight matrix by using [*dnearneigh()*](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/dnearneigh.html) as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
wm_d62 <- dnearneigh(coords, 0, 62, longlat = TRUE)
wm_d62
```

Next, *nb2listw()* is used to convert the nb object into spatial weights object.

```{r}
wm62_lw <- nb2listw(wm_d62, style = 'B')
summary(wm62_lw)
```

The output spatial weights object is called `wm62_lw`.

### **Computing adaptive distance weight matrix**

One of the characteristics of fixed distance weight matrix is that more densely settled areas (usually the urban areas) tend to have more neighbours and the less densely settled areas (usually the rural counties) tend to have lesser neighbours. Having many neighbours smoothes the neighbour relationship across more neighbours.

It is possible to control the numbers of neighbours directly using k-nearest neighbours, either accepting asymmetric neighbours or imposing symmetry as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
knn <- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=8))
knn
```

Next, *nb2listw()* is used to convert the nb object into spatial weights object.

```{r}
knn_lw <- nb2listw(knn, style = 'B')
summary(knn_lw)
```

## **Computing Gi statistics**

### **Gi statistics using fixed distance**

```{r}
fips <- order(hunan$County)
gi.fixed <- localG(hunan$GDPPC, wm62_lw)
gi.fixed
```

The output of localG() is a vector of G or Gstar values, with attributes "gstari" set to TRUE or FALSE, "call" set to the function call, and class "localG".

The Gi statistics is represented as a Z-score. Greater values represent a greater intensity of clustering and the direction (positive or negative) indicates high or low clusters.

Next, we will join the Gi values to their corresponding hunan sf data frame by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
hunan.gi <- cbind(hunan, as.matrix(gi.fixed)) %>%
  rename(gstat_fixed = as.matrix.gi.fixed.)
```

In fact, the code chunk above performs three tasks. First, it convert the output vector (i.e. *gi.fixed*) into r matrix object by using *as.matrix()*. Next, *cbind()* is used to join hunan\@data and *gi.fixed* matrix to produce a new SpatialPolygonDataFrame called *hunan.gi*. Lastly, the field name of the gi values is renamed to *gstat_fixed* by using *rename()*.

### **Mapping Gi values with fixed distance weights**

The code chunk below shows the functions used to map the Gi values derived using fixed distance weight matrix.

```{r}
gdppc <- qtm(hunan, "GDPPC")

Gimap <-tm_shape(hunan.gi) +
  tm_fill(col = "gstat_fixed", 
          style = "pretty",
          palette="-RdBu",
          title = "local Gi") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)

tmap_arrange(gdppc, Gimap, asp=1, ncol=2)
```

### **Gi statistics using adaptive distance**

The code chunk below are used to compute the Gi values for GDPPC2012 by using an adaptive distance weight matrix (i.e *knb_lw*).

```{r}
fips <- order(hunan$County)
gi.adaptive <- localG(hunan$GDPPC, knn_lw)
hunan.gi <- cbind(hunan, as.matrix(gi.adaptive)) %>%
  rename(gstat_adaptive = as.matrix.gi.adaptive.)

### **Mapping Gi values with adaptive distance weights**

It is time for us to visualise the locations of hot spot and cold spot areas. The choropleth mapping functions of **tmap** package will be used to map the Gi values.

The code chunk below shows the functions used to map the Gi values derived using fixed distance weight matrix.

```{r}
gdppc<- qtm(hunan, "GDPPC")

Gimap <- tm_shape(hunan.gi) + 
  tm_fill(col = "gstat_adaptive", 
          style = "pretty", 
          palette="-RdBu", 
          title = "local Gi") + 
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)

tmap_arrange(gdppc, 
             Gimap, 
             asp=1, 
             ncol=2)
```
